# Sql-Experiment

In this experiment I have used the chinook dataset(https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/blob/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite) to find the most popular songs with their total number of purchases and total profit. Chinook Dataset consists of several tables as shown in the image below.

It is a simple SQL code implemented in python jupyter notebook using sqlite3 library. All the tables are converted to a pandas dataframe in order to illustrate.
